# BallBoop!-Game-in-Python
Install Pygame in the command prompt or terminal. After this, you can run the game by copying the code into notepad and saving as "anything.py", then open with Python.
To play, move the paddle at the bottom of the screen using the arrow keys to deflect the ball into the green bars until they are gone, try to get to Level 20!
