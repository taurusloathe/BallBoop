# BallBoop!-Game-in-Python
20 difficult levels of Brick Attack meets Flappy Bird, can you even pass Level 1?! Use the arrow keys to move the paddle at the bottom to deflect the yellow ball into the green bars until youve booped them all! It's unknown what happens at the end if you actually beat the game, let's find out! Install Pygame in the command prompt or terminal. After this, you can run the game by copying the code into notepad and saving as "anything.py", then open with Python.
